# record-scatter
Adapted demo from Nextflow doing per-line processing

Original repository [here](https://github.com/nextflow-io/patterns/), inspired by `process-per-csv-record.nf`. The index.csv file is also from there, modified to meet my need for a tab delimited file and to test various parsing things.
